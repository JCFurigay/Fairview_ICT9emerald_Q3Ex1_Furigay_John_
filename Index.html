	    	<h2>Once honored defenders of Shurima against the Void, Aatrox and his brethren would eventually become an even greater threat to Runeterra, and were defeated only by cunning mortal sorcery. But after centuries of imprisonment, Aatrox was the first to find freedom once more, corrupting and transforming those foolish enough to try and wield the magical weapon that contained his essence. Now, with stolen flesh, he walks Runeterra in a brutal approximation of his previous form, seeking an apocalyptic and long overdue vengeance.</h2>

                   <h2>Claimed by the Void when she was only a child, Kai’Sa managed to survive through sheer tenacity and strength of will. Her experiences have made her a deadly hunter and, to some, the harbinger of a future they would rather not live to see. Having entered into an uneasy symbiosis with a living Void carapace, the time will soon come when she must decide whether to forgive those mortals who would call her a monster, and defeat the coming darkness together… or simply to forget, as the Void consumes the world that left her behind.</h2>

        	<h2>No one knows how many years passed before Martis reached the final secret world, but his desire for glory drove him onwards. After numerous defeats, he fell into despair, but even then, he refused to give up. He transformed his sheer thirst for victory into twin blades of righteous fury, now known as the Ashura's Teeth, and for countless days and nights, battled against the demons of the final world with strength and determination never seen before on the mortal plane. He finally became the first Ashura to defeat the three thousand secret worlds and has since been regarded as 'King Ashura', ruling tens of millions of aspiring Ashura</h2>
